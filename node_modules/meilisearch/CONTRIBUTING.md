## Assumptions

1. **You're familiar with [GitHub](https://github.com) and the [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (PR) workflow.**
2. **You've read the Meilisearch [documentation](https://docs.meilisearch.com) and the [README](/README.md).**
3. **You know about the [Meilisearch community](https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/what_is_meilisearch/contact.html). Please use this for help.**

## How to Contribute

1. Make sure that the contribution you want to make is explained or detailed in a GitHub issue! Find an [existing issue](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js/issues/) or [open a new one](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js/issues/new).
2. Once done, [fork the meilisearch-js repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) in your own GitHub account. Ask a maintainer if you want your issue to be checked before making a PR.
3. [Create a new Git branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository).
4. Review the [Development Workflow](#development-workflow) section that describes the steps to maintain the repository.
5. Make the changes on your branch.
6. [Submit the branch as a PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) pointing to the `main` branch of the main meilisearch-js repository. A maintainer should comment and/or review your Pull Request within a few days. Although depending on the circumstances, it may take longer.<br>
 We do not enforce a naming convention for the PRs, but **please use something descriptive of your changes**, having in mind that the title of your PR will be automatically added to the next [release changelog](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js/releases/).

## Development Workflow

### Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Node.js >= v12 and node <= 16
- Yarn


### Setup

You can set up your local environment natively or using `docker`, check out the [`docker-compose.yml`](/docker-compose.yml).

Example of running all the checks with docker:
```bash
docker-compose run --rm package bash -c "yarn install && yarn test && yarn lint"
```

To install dependencies:

```bash
yarn --dev
```

### Tests and Linter

Each PR should pass the tests and the linter to be accepted.

```bash
# Tests
curl -L https://install.meilisearch.com | sh # download Meilisearch
./meilisearch --master-key=masterKey --no-analytics # run Meilisearch
yarn test
# Linter
yarn style
# Linter with fixing
yarn style:fix
# Build the project
yarn build
```

## Git Guidelines

### Git Branches

All changes must be made in a branch and submitted as PR.
We do not enforce any branch naming style, but please use something descriptive of your changes.

### Git Commits

As minimal requirements, your commit message should:
- be capitalized
- not finish by a dot or any other punctuation character (!,?)
- start with a verb so that we can read your commit message this way: "This commit will ...", where "..." is the commit message.
  e.g.: "Fix the home page button" or "Add more tests for create_index method"

We don't follow any other convention, but if you want to use one, we recommend [this one](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

### GitHub Pull Requests

Some notes on GitHub PRs:

- [Convert your PR as a draft](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request) if your changes are a work in progress: no one will review it until you pass your PR as ready for review.<br>
  The draft PR can be very useful if you want to show that you are working on something and make your work visible.
- The branch related to the PR must be **up-to-date with `main`** before merging. Fortunately, this project [integrates a bot](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/resources/bors.md) to automatically enforce this requirement without the PR author having to do it manually.
- All PRs must be reviewed and approved by at least one maintainer.
- The PR title should be accurate and descriptive of the changes. The title of the PR will be indeed automatically added to the next [release changelogs](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js/releases/).

## Release Process (for internal team only)

Meilisearch tools follow the [Semantic Versioning Convention](https://semver.org/).

### Automation to Rebase and Merge the PRs

This project integrates a bot that helps us manage pull requests merging.<br>
_[Read more about this](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/resources/bors.md)._

### Automated Changelogs

This project integrates a tool to create automated changelogs.<br>
_[Read more about this](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/resources/release-drafter.md)._

### How to Publish the Release

‚ö†Ô∏è Before doing anything, make sure you got through the guide about [Releasing an Integration](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/resources/integration-release.md).

Make a PR modifying the following files with the right version:

[`package.json`](/package.json):
```javascript
"version": "X.X.X",
```

[`src/package-version`](/src/package-version.ts)
```javascript
export const PACKAGE_VERSION = 'X.X.X'
```

Once the changes are merged on `main`, you can publish the current draft release via the [GitHub interface](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js/releases): on this page, click on `Edit` (related to the draft release) > update the description (be sure you apply [these recommandations](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/resources/integration-release.md#writting-the-release-description)) > when you are ready, click on `Publish release`.

GitHub Actions will be triggered and push the package to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/meilisearch).

#### Release a `beta` Version

Here are the steps to release a beta version of this package:

- Create a new branch originating the branch containing the "beta" changes. For example, if during the Meilisearch pre-release, create a branch originating `bump-meilisearch-v*.*.*`.<br>
`vX.X.X` is the next version of the package, NOT the version of Meilisearch!

```bash
git checkout bump-meilisearch-v*.*.*
git pull origin bump-meilisearch-v*.*.*
git checkout -b vX.X.X-beta.0
```

- Change the version in `package.json` with `X.X.X-beta.0` and commit it to the `vX.X.X-beta.0` branch

- Go to the [GitHub interface for releasing](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js/releases): on this page, click on `Draft a new release`.

- Create a GitHub pre-release:
  - Fill the description with the detailed changelogs
  - Fill the title with `vX.X.X-beta.0`
  - Fill the tag with `vX.X.X-beta.0`
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Select the `vX.X.X-beta.0` branch and NOT `main`
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Click on the "This is a pre-release" checkbox
  - Click on "Publish release"

GitHub Actions will be triggered and push the beta version to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/meilisearch).

üí° If you need to release a new beta for the same version (i.e. `vX.X.X-beta.1`):
- merge the change into `bump-meilisearch-v*.*.*`
- rebase the `vX.X.X-beta.0` branch
- change the version name in `package.json`
- creata a pre-release via the GitHub interface
